# Experiment notes

Narrative

- Changing environments promote multiple kinds of evolvability
  - Evolution of bigger mutation rate
    - Bigger pool of standing variation in the population when mutation rate is elevated?
  - Evolution of evolvable genetic architectures

Extra analyses

- Genetic architecture (e.g., task overlap)
- Are reproduction rate refractory periods getting shorter over time?
  - Look for rate of recovering 50% of previous reproduction rate

Extra experiments

- Changing environment where tasks randomly change from rewarded to punished (remove correlations between tasks)
  - Each change randomizes the set of rewarded and punished tasks
  - Hypotheses:
    - Mutation rate even more important to maintain/increase because genomes need to be *more* evolvable to keep up with environment (i.e., each task needs to be independently toggled)
    - No correlations between tasks results in decreasing mutation rate
- What does mutation rate do when there is a single task fluctuating?
