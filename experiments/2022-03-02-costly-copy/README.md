# 2022-03-02 - Costly copy instruction exploratory experiment

From other experiments, we know that mutation rates evolve toward zero in constant environments.
In this experiment, we impose a cost on high-fidelity h-copy instruction operators. I.e., the lower the mutation rate, the higher the cost.
